# Future features
## 1. Allow patients sent over with validated fields to be added to database. 
Currently, if one patient has fields that are invalid, all the patients sent are not added.  
I would like to improve the code to allow those with valid fields to be added, while providing the appropriate error message.

# Refactoring
## 1. Create function for creating patient in database instead of having it in store function of controller.
